# LLMs

Learning about large language models (LLMs) and their related technologies is an exciting journey! Since you're a beginner, I’ll craft a detailed roadmap that starts with the basics and gradually builds up to advanced concepts. I’ll also sprinkle in some project ideas you can work on along the way to solidify your understanding. Let’s dive in!

### Tips for Success
- **Hands-on Practice**: Code every day, even if it’s just 30 minutes.
- **Start Small**: Don’t jump to GPT-3-sized models right away—build intuition with simpler ones.
- **Ask Questions**: Use forums like Stack Overflow or Reddit if stuck.
- **Be Patient**: LLMs are complex, but each step builds your skills!
